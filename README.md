# Fwww 

 Fwww is the repository for fast Web server applications.
 It is based on C++ for fast Web project development, release, and deployment.
 In fwww, the light-weight and fast Web server lighttpd serves user requests,
 which are handed over to C++/C fastcgi processes. The C++/C fastcgi processes
 connect to the back-end JaguarDB for data reads and writes.
 The back-end JaguarDB is a highly scalable distributed NoSQL database, developed
 with C++/C. It is a fast NoSQL datastore to manage time-series and location data.
